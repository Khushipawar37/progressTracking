Day 3: Built the suggestion section, progressing to complete the major UI components for the clone.(Restarting the streak, trying to remain more consistent)

Day 4: Completed the posts section thereby finishing the home page. 

Day 5: Added logic for incrementing likes and comments count. 

Day 6: Made the site responsive and hence submitted a basic clone though lot of refining and work is still required to be done on it.
